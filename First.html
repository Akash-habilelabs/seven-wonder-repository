                Hatchbacks are one of the most popular car body types in terms of overall sales in India. A hatchback can be defined as a vehicle body type that comprises four doors along with an additional rear hatch that opens upward to access the boot space. Hatchbacks are generally designed with compact bodies and are perfect for comfortably seating up to five passengers. Nonetheless, the most striking feature of this segment is the boot: a space behind the rear seats that exists inside the car itself, rather than as a separate space. Thus, when you open the hinged boot of a hatchback, you are practically opening the car itself. <br>

Hatchbacks are considered the best for city driving as they’re easy to manoeuvre through traffic and compact enough to drive on narrow streets. Their smaller two-box design makes them easier to park. Though there isn’t a specific criterion for size and engine displacement, hatchbacks usually come with a size of under 4 meters and an engine capacity of 0.8 to 1.5 litres. The most striking feature of this segment is its impeccable fuel economy and affordable price point.
